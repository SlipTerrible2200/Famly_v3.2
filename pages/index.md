## Personal
I'm a husband, father and a brother. I live by NÃ¸rrebroparken in a tiny apartment with my wife and two babies. She and I met in Sydney, Australia back in 2015.
We have familial ties to Mexico, Denmark and Sweden.

I have spent years and years playing, coaching and refereeing basketball. I also love playing and watching football, and enjoy golfing while refusing to watch it! You can always initiate conversation with me by asking me about 'the game'.

I currently lead and teach a weekly evening class for adults about biblical litteracy and faith in my local church, which is greatly rewarding.
